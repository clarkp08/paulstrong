	<h2>Inspiration for this website</h2>

		<p>My friend was involved in a life threatening motorcycle accident recently, and he is the inspiration for this website. Paul is the most driven person I know, and he is most passionate about fitness. While he continues to fight each and every day, I decided to do something fitness related every day, and record each step of the way as he makes his progress. Paul is inspiring me to be a better athlete, developer, and person. One day, he will be able to see the impact he has on my life, among the countless others he has impacted.</p>
