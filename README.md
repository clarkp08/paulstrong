My friend was involved in a life threatening motorcycle accident recently, and he is the inspiration for this website. Paul is the most driven person I know, and he is most passionate about fitness. While he continues to fight each and every day, I decided to do something fitness related every day, and record each step of the way as he makes his progress. 

Using HTML/CSS/JS, I want to also focus on becoming a better front end coder. Paul is inspiring me to be a better athlete, developer, and person. When he is back to full strength, he will be able to see the impact he has on my life, among the countless others he has impacted.
